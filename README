MySocket was a project I worked on in 1999-2002 when I was learning about socket programming in Windows.  

In 2002, I was learning Java and liked how simple it was so I created an object-oriented interface and also ported it for use in Linux.

A lot of my projects since then utilize this library.

# to build debian package
